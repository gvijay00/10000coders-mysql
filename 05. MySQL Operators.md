#  MySQL Operators 

Operators in MySQL are used to perform operations on data. They can be classified into the following types:

---

## 1.  **Arithmetic Operators**

Used to perform basic mathematical operations.

| Operator | Description         | Example          | Output |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| `+`      | Addition            | `SELECT 10 + 5;` | `15`   |
| `-`      | Subtraction         | `SELECT 10 - 5;` | `5`    |
| `*`      | Multiplication      | `SELECT 10 * 5;` | `50`   |
| `/`      | Division            | `SELECT 10 / 5;` | `2`    |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) | `SELECT 10 % 3;` | `1`    |

---

## 2.  **Comparison (Relational) Operators**

Used to compare values.

| Operator     | Description              | Example          | Result     |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------- |
| `=`          | Equal to                 | `SELECT 5 = 5;`  | `1 (TRUE)` |
| `<>` or `!=` | Not equal to             | `SELECT 5 <> 6;` | `1`        |
| `>`          | Greater than             | `SELECT 6 > 5;`  | `1`        |
| `<`          | Less than                | `SELECT 3 < 5;`  | `1`        |
| `>=`         | Greater than or equal to | `SELECT 5 >= 5;` | `1`        |
| `<=`         | Less than or equal to    | `SELECT 4 <= 5;` | `1`        |

 **Used in WHERE clause** to filter rows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary >= 50000;
```

---

## 3.  **Logical Operators**

Used to combine multiple conditions.

| Operator | Description                          | Example                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `AND`    | TRUE if **both** conditions are true | `SELECT 1=1 AND 2=2;` → `1` |
| `OR`     | TRUE if **at least one** is true     | `SELECT 1=1 OR 1=2;` → `1`  |
| `NOT`    | Inverts the result                   | `SELECT NOT(1=1);` → `0`    |

 Example in WHERE clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT' AND salary > 40000;
```

---

## 4.  **Special Operators**

### a. `IN` / `NOT IN`

Checks whether a value exists in a list.

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE city IN ('Delhi', 'Mumbai');
```

### b. `BETWEEN` / `NOT BETWEEN`

Checks whether a value is within a range.

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 100 AND 500;
```

### c. `IS` / `IS NOT`

Used with NULL values.

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE delivery_date IS NULL;
```

### d. `LIKE` / `NOT LIKE`

Used for pattern matching.

| Pattern | Meaning                 |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| `%`     | Zero or more characters |
| `_`     | A single character      |

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

---

## 5.  **Subquery Operators**

Used with subqueries to compare with sets.

### a. `ALL`

Compares value to **all values** in a list or subquery.

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
WHERE salary > ALL (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR');
```

### b. `ANY`

Compares value to **any one** value in a list or subquery.

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
WHERE salary > ANY (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR');
```
