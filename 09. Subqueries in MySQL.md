#  Subqueries in MySQL


## 🔷 What is a Subquery?

A **Subquery** is a **query inside another query**.

* The **inner query** (subquery) runs **first** and sends its result to the **outer query** (main query).
* It helps when you need to **use the result of one query inside another**.

###  Think of it as:

> “Get me the names of employees who earn **more than the average salary**.”
> To do this, we first need the average salary → subquery
> Then compare each employee's salary to it → main query

## 🔶 Why Do We Need Subqueries?

Subqueries help in:

1. Writing cleaner and **modular queries**
2. Solving problems where **data depends on data**
3. Avoiding complex joins in **filter-based logic**
4. Creating **dynamic conditions** using calculations

---

## 🔸 Subquery Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1
FROM table
WHERE column2 OPERATOR (
    SELECT column
    FROM another_table
    WHERE condition
);
```

---

## 🔷 Types of Subqueries

---

### 1. Single-Row Subquery

🔹 Returns **only one value (one row, one column)**
🔹 Used with operators like `=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, etc.

**Example:** Find employees whose salary is greater than the **average salary**.

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

---

### 2. Multi-Row Subquery

🔹 Returns **multiple rows (one column)**
🔹 Use with `IN`, `ANY`, or `ALL`

**Example:** Find employees in departments that have more than 5 employees.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
);
```

---

### 3. Multi-Column Subquery

🔹 Returns **more than one column (single row)**
🔹 Used when comparing **tuples (pairs or sets)**

**Example:** Find employees who have the same department and salary as 'John'.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE (department_id, salary) = (
    SELECT department_id, salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE name = 'John'
);
```

---

### 4. Correlated Subquery

🔹 Subquery that **depends on the outer query**
🔹 It runs **once for every row** in the outer query
🔹 Usually used when comparing values **within a group**

**Example:** Find employees who earn more than the **average salary in their department**.

```sql
SELECT name, salary, department_id
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e1.department_id = e2.department_id
);
```

 This compares each employee’s salary to the average **within their own department**.

---

### 5. Nested Subquery

🔹 A subquery **inside another subquery**
🔹 Useful for solving multi-level logic

**Example:** Find employees who work in the department with the **highest number of employees**.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM (
        SELECT department_id
        FROM employees
        GROUP BY department_id
        ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
        LIMIT 1
    ) AS top_dept
);
```

---

## 🔸 Special Subquery Operators

---

### ALL Operator

Compares a value to **all values** returned by the subquery.

**Example:** Get employees whose salary is **greater than all salaries** in department 30.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > ALL (
    SELECT salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = 30
);
```

Returns only those whose salary is higher than the **highest** salary in dept 30.

---

### ANY Operator

Compares a value to **any one** of the values returned by the subquery.

**Example:** Get employees who earn more than **anyone** in department 10.

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > ANY (
    SELECT salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = 10
);
```

Returns those whose salary is higher than at least **one** person in dept 10.

## 🔹 When Should You Use Subqueries?

| Situation                                | Use Subquery? |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Filtering based on **calculated values** | ✅             |
| Avoiding **complex joins**               | ✅             |
| Reusing **intermediate data**            | ✅             |
| Need **row-by-row** comparison           | ✅             |
| Want better **readability**              | ✅             |

## 🔸 Subquery vs JOIN – What to Use?

| Feature            | Subquery                         | JOIN                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Performance        | Slower for large data            | Faster with indexes                  |
| Readability        | Easier for filtering, conditions | Easier for full row comparison       |
| Use with aggregate | Ideal (`AVG()`, `MAX()`, etc.)   | Less readable with nested aggregates |
| Execution          | Inner query first                | All tables joined first              |

##  Real-World Use Cases

| Task                                             | Subquery Used                    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Get employees who earn more than department avg  | Correlated Subquery              |
| List products with same price as another product | Multi-Column Subquery            |
| Filter users in top performing region            | Nested Subquery                  |
| Compare salary to highest salary in another team | Subquery + ALL operator          |
| Fetch employees working in busiest department    | Subquery with ORDER BY and LIMIT |

##  Summary Table

| Type                | Returns                | Best Used With                |
