## 🔹 1. GROUP BY in MySQL

###  Definition:

`GROUP BY` is used to **group rows** that have the same values in specified columns into **summary rows**, like totals or counts.

###  Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
```

###  Common Aggregate Functions:

* `COUNT()` – Number of rows
* `SUM()` – Total sum
* `AVG()` – Average value
* `MAX()` – Highest value
* `MIN()` – Lowest value

### ✅ Example:

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

🔹 *This groups employees by department and shows how many are in each.*

---

## 🔹 2. HAVING Clause

###  Definition:

`HAVING` is used to **filter group-level results** (i.e., after `GROUP BY`). It's like a `WHERE` clause for groups.

###  Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column2) condition;
```

###  Example:

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

🔹 *This shows only departments that have more than 5 employees.*

> 🔸 **Note:** `WHERE` filters **before** grouping, `HAVING` filters **after** grouping.

---

## 🔹 3. ORDER BY Clause

###  Definition:

`ORDER BY` is used to **sort the result set** by one or more columns.

###  Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC];
```

###  Example:

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

🔹 *This sorts employees by salary from highest to lowest.*

> 🔸 Default sorting is `ASC` (ascending). Use `DESC` for descending.

---

## 🔹 4. LIMIT Clause

###  Definition:

`LIMIT` restricts the number of rows returned in the result.

###  Syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT number;
```

###  Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
LIMIT 5;
```

🔹 *Returns only the first 5 rows.*

---

## 🔹 5. OFFSET Clause

###  Definition:

`OFFSET` skips the first N rows before starting to return the rows.

###  Syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT number OFFSET offset_value;
```

OR

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT offset_value, number;
```

###  Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;
```

🔹 *Skips the first 10 rows and shows the next 5.*

> 🔸 Equivalent to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
LIMIT 10, 5;
```

---

## 🔹 Combined Example

###  Task:

List the top 3 departments with the highest total salary, but only if their average salary is more than 50000.

```sql
SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000
ORDER BY total_salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
---

## 🔹 6. DISTINCT Keyword

### 📌 Definition:

`DISTINCT` is used to **remove duplicate values** from the result set and return only **unique values**.

### 📌 Syntax:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

### ✅ Example 1: Unique Departments

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees;
```

🔹 *This returns each department name only once, even if multiple employees belong to the same department.*

---

### ✅ Example 2: Unique Department-Salary Pairs

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department, salary
FROM employees;
```

🔹 *This ensures each (department, salary) combination is unique in the result.*

---

### ✅ Example 3: Count Unique Departments

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department) AS unique_departments
FROM employees;
```

🔹 *This counts how many unique departments exist.*

---

### ⚡ Key Points about DISTINCT

1. **Applies to all selected columns** – duplicates are removed based on the entire row, not just one column.
2. Often used with `COUNT()` to get counts of unique values.
3. Can be **performance heavy** on large datasets (since it requires sorting or hashing to remove duplicates).

## 🔹 Updated Summary Table

| Clause     | Purpose                           | Used With       | Can Use Aggregate? | Executes Before/After GROUP BY |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `DISTINCT` | Remove duplicate rows             | SELECT          | ✅ With COUNT()     | Before GROUP BY                |
| `GROUP BY` | Group rows based on column values | SELECT + AGG FN | ✅ Yes              | —                              |
| `HAVING`   | Filter groups after aggregation   | GROUP BY        | ✅ Yes              | After GROUP BY                 |
| `ORDER BY` | Sort the results                  | Any SELECT      | ✅ Yes              | After GROUP BY                 |
| `LIMIT`    | Restrict number of rows           | SELECT          | ❌ No               | After final result set         |
| `OFFSET`   | Skip initial rows                 | SELECT + LIMIT  | ❌ No               | After final result set         |

## 🔹 Real-world Use Case with DISTINCT

👉 Show unique job titles in a company, sorted alphabetically, but only the first 5.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT job_title
FROM employees
ORDER BY job_title ASC
LIMIT 5;
```

🔹 *This lists 5 unique job titles in alphabetical order.*
