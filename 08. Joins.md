#  MySQL Joins 

## ðŸ”· What are Joins?

A **JOIN** in SQL is used to **combine rows from two or more tables** based on a **related column** between them.

### Why do we need JOINS?

In relational databases:

* Data is split into multiple **normalized tables** to avoid redundancy.
* Joins help in **retrieving meaningful data** from multiple tables in a **single result set**.
* Without JOINs, we would have to run multiple queries and manually merge results.

### Example:

Suppose you have two tables:

**Table: employees**

| emp\_id | name  | dept\_id |
| ------- | ----- | -------- |
| 1       | Alice | 10       |
| 2       | Bob   | 20       |
| 3       | Carol | 30       |

**Table: departments**

| dept\_id | dept\_name |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 10       | HR         |
| 20       | IT         |

To get a list of employees along with their department names, we need to **JOIN** these tables on `dept_id`.

## ðŸ”¶ Join Condition

The **join condition** is written using the `ON` keyword and tells SQL how to match rows between two tables.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

This **common column** is usually a **foreign key in one table** referring to a **primary key in another**.

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Joins in MySQL

![join](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQHTsN5So0yjGA/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1694185702315?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=HoZ4EWgIP3kT4UpUwJH0JQR0VqIY3GoPYSWxdVgB5IA "join")


### 1. INNER JOIN

Returns only rows that have **matching values** in both tables.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id;
```

**Result:**

| name  | dept\_name |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Alice | HR         |
| Bob   | IT         |

Carol is excluded because her `dept_id = 30` doesn't exist in the departments table.

---

### 2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

Returns **all rows from the left table**, and matched rows from the right table.
If no match, the result contains **NULL** for right table columns.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments
ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id;
```

**Result:**

| name  | dept\_name |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Alice | HR         |
| Bob   | IT         |
| Carol | NULL       |

---

### 3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

Returns **all rows from the right table**, and matched rows from the left table.
If no match, the result contains **NULL** for left table columns.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments
ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id;
```

**Result:**

| name  | dept\_name |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Alice | HR         |
| Bob   | IT         |
| NULL  | Finance    |

This shows departments that might not yet have employees assigned.

---

### 4. FULL OUTER JOIN (Not directly supported in MySQL)

Simulates combining **LEFT JOIN** and **RIGHT JOIN** using `UNION`.

**Syntax (MySQL workaround):**

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments
ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id

UNION

SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments
ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id;
```

This returns **all rows** from both tables, with NULLs for missing matches.

---

### 5. CROSS JOIN

Returns the **Cartesian product** of both tables.
Every row in the first table is joined with **every row** in the second table.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
```

If employees has 3 rows and departments has 2 rows, the result will have **3 x 2 = 6 rows**.

Used rarelyâ€”mostly for generating combinations or test data.

---

### 6. SELF JOIN

Used to join a table with itself.
Helpful for finding relationships within the same table (e.g., manager â†’ employee).

**Example Table: employees**

| emp\_id | name  | manager\_id |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| 1       | Alice | NULL        |
| 2       | Bob   | 1           |
| 3       | Carol | 1           |

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT e.name AS Employee, m.name AS Manager
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m
ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id;
```

**Result:**

| Employee | Manager |
| -------- | ------- |
| Bob      | Alice   |
| Carol    | Alice   |

## Summary Table

| Join Type  | Description                                   | Includes Non-Matching Rows |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| INNER JOIN | Matches in both tables                        | No                         |
| LEFT JOIN  | All left table rows, matched from right       | Yes (right table NULLs)    |
| RIGHT JOIN | All right table rows, matched from left       | Yes (left table NULLs)     |
| FULL JOIN  | All rows from both, matched or not            | Yes (both table NULLs)     |
| CROSS JOIN | All possible combinations (Cartesian product) | Not based on matching      |
| SELF JOIN  | Joins table with itself                       | Based on condition         |
