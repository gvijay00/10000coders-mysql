# ðŸ”¹ TCL (Transaction Control Language) in MySQL

##  1. **Definition**

TCL commands in MySQL are used to control and manage **transactions** in a database. A **transaction** is a group of SQL operations (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) that are executed as a single unit. These commands ensure **data integrity**, **atomicity**, and **consistency**.

---

##  2. **Why Transactions?**

### ðŸ”¸ Real-world Example:

Imagine transferring â‚¹1000 from Account A to Account B:

* Deduct â‚¹1000 from A
* Add â‚¹1000 to B

If the first succeeds but the second fails, the data becomes inconsistent. TCL ensures both happen or none.

##  3. **ACID Properties of a Transaction**

| Property    | Meaning                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Atomicity   | All or none of the operations are performed                  |
| Consistency | Database remains consistent before and after the transaction |
| Isolation   | Each transaction is independent                              |
| Durability  | Once committed, the data is permanently saved                |

##  4. **TCL Commands in MySQL**

### ðŸ”¹ A. `SET AUTOCOMMIT`

**Purpose:**
Enables or disables automatic commit of each SQL statement.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SET AUTOCOMMIT = {0 | 1};
```

**Explanation:**

* `SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0;` â†’ Manual control. You must use COMMIT or ROLLBACK.
* `SET AUTOCOMMIT = 1;` â†’ Default. Each statement is committed instantly.

---

### ðŸ”¹ B. `START TRANSACTION` / `BEGIN`

**Purpose:**
Begins a new transaction block.

**Syntax:**

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
-- or
BEGIN;
```

**Example:**

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 1000 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ C. `COMMIT`

**Purpose:**
Permanently saves all changes made during the current transaction.

**Syntax:**

```sql
COMMIT;
```

**Real-life Use Case:**

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE orders SET status='SHIPPED' WHERE order_id = 101;
COMMIT; -- Saves change
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ D. `ROLLBACK`

**Purpose:**
Cancels all changes made in the current transaction and reverts the database to its previous state.

**Syntax:**

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

**Example:**

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE id = 1;
-- error happens here
ROLLBACK;
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ E. `SAVEPOINT`

**Purpose:**
Creates a **checkpoint** within a transaction to which you can roll back partially.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
```

**Example:**

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE users SET name='Amit' WHERE id=10;
SAVEPOINT sp1;
UPDATE users SET name='Sumit' WHERE id=10;
ROLLBACK TO sp1; -- Only last update is reverted
COMMIT;
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ F. `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`

**Purpose:**
Undo changes up to a specific savepoint.

**Syntax:**

```sql
ROLLBACK TO savepoint_name;
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ G. `RELEASE SAVEPOINT`

**Purpose:**
Deletes a previously defined savepoint to free resources.

**Syntax:**

```sql
RELEASE SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
```

##  5. **Use Case Scenarios**

| Use Case                             | TCL Command Used                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Bank money transfer                  | START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK |
| Partially undo updates               | SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT    |
| Batch processing in ecommerce orders | COMMIT, ROLLBACK on error           |
| Manual control of data change        | SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0                  |

## 6. **Summary Table**

| Command                 | Purpose                    | Can Undo? | Scope              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| `SET AUTOCOMMIT`        | Enable/disable auto commit | No        | Session-level      |
| `START TRANSACTION`     | Begin a new transaction    | Yes       | Block of commands  |
| `COMMIT`                | Save changes               | No        | Entire transaction |
| `ROLLBACK`              | Undo changes               | Yes       | Entire transaction |
| `SAVEPOINT`             | Set a restore point        | Yes       | Partial rollback   |
| `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` | Undo to a savepoint        | Yes       | From savepoint     |
